My Name is Libbie Farrell and I am an Artist and coder experimenting with ways to incorporate my artistic and design based practice into interactive code based projects. I am a printmaker and textile artist outside my love for software engineering and a strong believer in learning new skills all the time.

This github is primarily used for my personal and more strange projects.
